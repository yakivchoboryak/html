            <dd> 
                is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport">team sport</a>  in which two teams of six
              players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by
              grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It
              has been a part of the official program of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> since
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics">Tokyo 1964</a>.
            
            </dd>
        </p>
        <p>
              The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball#Rules_of_the_game">complete set of rules</a> is extensive, but play essentially proceeds
              as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the
              ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm),
              from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into
              the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball
              be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3
              times, but individual players may not touch the ball twice
              consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up
              for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a
              way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in
              their court.
          </p>
    

  
        <ul>
          <li><b>causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;</b></li>
          <li><b>catching and throwing the ball;</b></li>
          <li><b>double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;</b></li>
          <li><b>four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;</b></li>
          <li><b>net foul: touching the net during play;</b></li>
          <li><b>foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.</b></li>
      </ul> 
    
    
          <p>
              <b>The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.</b></p>
              <p>
              A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the 
              vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures.

<h4>Origin of volleyball</h4>

    <p>
        In the winter of 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created 
        a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and 
        by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as tennis and handball. Another 
        indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the 
        city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than 
        basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft (7.6 m × 15.2 m) 
        court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and 
        no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving 
        error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except 
        in the case of the first-try serve.
    </p>
    <p>
        After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the 
        International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally 
        spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the 
        game spread around the country to various YMCAs.
    </p>

  
      <h4>Refinements and later developments</h4>
    <p>
      <img height="200" width="300" class="leftimg" src="https://bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/1182x887/73542228.jpg?k=f42ea77af5c0919d2b9a3651c4a744cfaa9cf625b66e3c851080e7f74bf61a11&o=?size=S" 
  alt="Photo" >
        The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others
        claim it was created in 1900. The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike 
        had been introduced, and four years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. 
        In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs 
        were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new 
        countries.
    </p>

     <p>
        The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900. An international federation, the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_Volleyball">Fédération Internationale de Volleyball</a> 
          (<abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr>), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 
          for men and 1952 for women. The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe (where especially Italy, the Netherlands, and 
          countries from Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s), in Russia, and in other countries including China 
          and the rest of Asia, as well as in the United States.
    </p>  

    <p>
          <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball">Beach volleyball</a></b>, a variation of the game played on sand and 
          with only two players per team, became a <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr>-endorsed 
          variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Volleyball is also a sport 
          at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.

      alt="Photo">
      <h4>The court dimensions</h4>
    <p>
      A volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of one meter (39.4 in). The top of the net is 2.43 m
       (7 ft 11 11⁄16 in) above the center of the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4 3⁄16 in) for women's competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions.
    <p></p>
    The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23.0 ft), although a clearance of 8 m (26.2 ft) is recommended.
    <p></p>
    A line 3 m (9.8 ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the "attack line". This "3 meter" (or "10-foot") line divides the court into "back row" and
     "front row" areas (also back court and front court). These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area "1", which
      is the position of the serving player:
    </p>
      <p>
        After a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise direction, with the player previously in area "2" moving
       to area "1" and so on, with the player from area "1" moving to area "6". Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service;
        the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.
      </p>
    <p>
        The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which the players may enter and play within after the
        service of the ball. All lines denoting the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are
          therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered to be "in". An antenna is placed on each side of the
          net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the
            antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.
    </p>


<h4>The ball</h4>


    <p>
      <i> Main article: Volleyball (ball)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a circumference of 65–67 cm, a weight of 260–280 g and an inside pressure
       of 0.30–0.325 kg/cm2. Other governing bodies have similar regulations.
      </p>
    <h4>Gameplay</h4>
    <p>
      Each team consists of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts
       to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must use a combination of no more
        than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's
         trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter
          so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping,
           raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net. The team
            with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top
       (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players
        arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball). After a successful dig, the team
         transitions to offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made.
       The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball
        to land outside the court. A ball is "in" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a sideline or end-line, and a strong spike
         may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may actually be in. Players may travel well outside
          the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player "catching" the ball, a player touching the net
       while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the net into the opponent's court. There are a large number of other
        errors specified in the rules, although most of them are infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players spiking 
        the ball or blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not being in the correct
         position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the frontcourt and above the height of the net, using another player as a source 
         of support to reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve, or playing the ball 
         when it is above the opponent's court.
    </p>


<h4>Scoring</h4>

    <p>
      A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made: when the ball strikes one team's side of the court,
       the other team gains a point; and when an error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to whether
        they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point.
         If the team that won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the
          players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by
           a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points. (Scoring differs between leagues,
            tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are played best-of-five to 25 as of the 2008 season.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Before 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve (side-out scoring) and all sets went up to only 15 points. The <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr> changed
       the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in 2000) to use the current scoring system (formerly known as rally point system), primarily
        to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and television-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final year of side-out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championship was 2000. Rally point scoring debuted in 2001,
       and games were played to 30 points through 2007. For the 2008 season, games were renamed "sets" and reduced to 25 points to win. Most high
        schools in the U.S. changed to rally scoring in 2003, and several states implemented it the previous year on an experimental basis.
    </p>


<h4>Libero</h4>

    <p>
        The libero player was introduced internationally in 1998, and made its debut for NCAA competition in 2002. The libero is a player
        specialized in defensive skills: the libero must wear a contrasting jersey color from their teammates and cannot block or attack 
        the ball when it is entirely above net height. When the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player, without 
        prior notice to the officials. This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set, although
          the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
        The modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the libero is typically responsible for the second
      ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero
        must be standing behind (and not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3-meter line.
        An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court.
      </p>
    <p>
        The libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero tracking sheet, where the referees or officiating team
        must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for. Under <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr> rules, two liberos are designated at the beginning of the play, only one of whom can
          be on the court at any time.
      </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, a libero is not allowed to serve, according to international rules. NCAA rules for both men and women differ on this point; a 2004 rule change
        allows the libero to serve, but only in a specific rotation. That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not for all of the people for whom he or
          she goes in. That rule change was also applied to high school and junior high play soon after.
    </p>

    <h4>Recent rule changes</h4>
    <p>
      Other rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as long as it goes over the net into the opponents' court.
       Also, the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines.
        Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches, such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player ("double-hits")
         on a team's first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained
        at 30 for another three years, switching to 25 in 2011.) If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In addition, the word 
        "game" is now referred to as "set".
        <p></p>
        The Official Volleyball Rules are prepared and updated every few years by the <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr>'s Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission. The latest edition is usually
        available on the <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Volleyball">FIVB</abbr>'s website.

<div class="name">
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  </div>

<div>
<p>
    Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of these skills comprises a number of specific techniques that have been
   introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.
</p>

<h4>Serve</h4>

  <p>
      A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball, in an attempt to drive it into the opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court;
      it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly. A serve is called an
        "ace" when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after being touched by an opponent; when the only player on the server's team to touch
        the ball is the server.
      <p></p>
      In contemporary volleyball, many types of serves are employed:
  </p>


<section>
<ul>
  <li>Underhand: a serve in which the player strikes the ball below the waist instead of tossing it up and striking it with an overhand throwing motion. Underhand serves are considered very easy to receive and are rarely employed in high-level competitions.</li>
  <li>Sky ball serve: a specific type of underhand serve occasionally used in beach volleyball, where the ball is hit so high it comes down almost in a straight line. This serve was invented and employed almost exclusively by the Brazilian team in the early 1980s and is now considered outdated. During the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, the sky ball serve was extensively played by Italian beach volleyball player Adrian Carambula. In Brazil, this serve is called Jornada nas Estrelas (Star Trek)</li>
  <li>Topspin: an overhand serve where the player tosses the ball high and hits it with a wrist snap, giving it topspin which causes it to drop faster than it would otherwise and helps maintain a straight flight path. Topspin serves are generally hit hard and aimed at a specific returner or part of the court. Standing topspin serves are rarely used above the high school level of play.</li>
  <li>Float: an overhand serve where the ball is hit with no spin so that its path becomes unpredictable, akin to a knuckleball in baseball.</li>
  <li>Jump serve: an overhand serve where the ball is first tossed high in the air, then the player makes a timed approach and jumps to make contact with the ball, hitting it with much pace and topspin. This is the most popular serve among college and professional teams.</li>
  <li>Jump float: an overhand serve where the ball is tossed high enough that the player may jump before hitting it similarly to a standing float serve. The ball is tossed lower than a topspin jump serve, but contact is still made while in the air. This serve is becoming more popular among college and professional players because it has a certain unpredictability in its flight pattern. It is the only serve where the server's feet can go over the inline.</li>

<h4>Pass</h4>

    <p>Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball
      from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.
      </p>
    <p>
        The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform,
        at waistline; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head. Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball; however,
          there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball. When a player passes a ball to their setter, it's ideal that the ball does not have a lot of
          spin to make it easier for the setter.
    </p>

    <h4>Set</h4>
    <p>
        The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball. The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack
        into the opponent's court. The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used
        only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of
          a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a jump set that
          is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands
            about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent's court. This movement is called a
      "dump". This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack. The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball
        behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.
      </p>
    <p>
      As with a set or an overhand pass, the setter/passer must be careful to touch the ball with both hands at the same time. If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball
      this could result in a less effective set, as well as the referee calling a 'double hit' and giving the point to the opposing team.
